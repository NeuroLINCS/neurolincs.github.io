## Abstract

Data independent acquisition (DIA also termed SWATH) is an emerging technology in the field of mass spectrometry based proteomics. Although the concept of DIA has been around for over a decade, the recent advancements, in particular the speed of acquisition, of mass analyzers have pushed the technique into the spotlight and allowed for high-quality DIA data to be routinely acquired by proteomics labs. In this chapter we will discuss the protocols used for DIA acquisition using the Sciex TripleTOF mass spectrometers and data analysis using the Sciex processing software.
