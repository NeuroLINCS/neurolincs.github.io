Using imaging, we aim to empirically determine key features that distinguish cellular states and to develop models for predicting how cells respond to perturbagens. Using robotic microscopy (RM), we can identify and track individual cells over time and quantify the relationship between intermediate changes in cellular physiology and eventual fate. This quantitative molecular phenotyping enables us to construct multivariate predictive models of fate, which we will integrate with data generated from other NeuroLINCs sites, to provide comprehensive molecular “signatures” for our cell types of interest.
