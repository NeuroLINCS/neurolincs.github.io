The genetic disease background in iPSC lines from individuals with SMA (SMN1 mutation), C9ORF72 repeat expansion associated ALS (C9-ALS) and sporadic ALS are genetic perturbagens.  Importantly, additional chemical perturbagens will be selected based on their applicability to a wide range of cell types and cellular signaling pathways.
