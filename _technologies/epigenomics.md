We used the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) to assess chromatin accessibility and identify functional regulatory sites involved in driving transcriptional changes associated with cell responses to genetic perturbations. ATAC-Seq detects open chromatin sites and maps transcription factor binding events in regulatory elements genome-wide, without needing any prior information about which proteins are bound. ATAC-Seq signals allow for the delineation of fine-scale architectures of the regulatory framework by correlating occupancy patterns with other features, such as global gene induction programs.
