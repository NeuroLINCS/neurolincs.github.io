RNA-Seq is a deep sequencing approach to transcriptome profiling that allows us to precisely measure the extent and complexity of transcriptional perturbations. We have now generated deep sequencing data representing quantitative differences in mRNA expression between control and diseased patient-derived iPSCs and iMNs.
