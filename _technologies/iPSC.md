Motor neurons (iMNs) are generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with ALS and SMA and for unaffected controls. The iPSC core facility at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) has coordinated iPS cell expansion and differentiation protocols to ensure consistency across sites. We have developed standard operating procedures (SOPs), QC measures, and an improved protocol for the maintenance and differentiation of the cells.
