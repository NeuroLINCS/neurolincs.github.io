## iPSC (Exp 1) - ALS, SMA and Control (unaffected) subject-derived iPSC lines.

### WGS, RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and SWATH-MS were carried out on isolated mRNA, DNA and protein respectively obtained from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) cell lines. These lines were derived from ALS, SMA and Control (unaffected) individuals (three of each).
