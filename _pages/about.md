# Rationale

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative condition characterized by loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. It is also commonly known as “Lou Gehrig’s Disease” in the USA and “motor neuron disease” in Europe and the rest of the world. ALS presents clinically as muscle wasting with stiffness and spasticity from loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord. New research indicates that a substantial number of ALS patients also have mild to moderate dementia, and pathological studies document neurodegeneration and abnormal astroglial/oligodendroglial functions throughput the brain and spinal cord.

ALS is largely sporadic, but several genes, including SOD1, C9orf72 and TDP43 have been identified in a subset of patients. Clinically sporadic and familial ALS appear similar. The C9orf72 mutation is unusual in several regards: it is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion of the first intron of the gene and the expansion may repeat thousands of times; the mutation is found in ~40% of familial ALS – but also in 8-10% of apparent sporadic disease as well. Finally, it is equally common in frontotemporal dementia- both in the familial and sporadic forms. ALS patients with severe frontotemporal dementia most often carry the C9orf72 mutation. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a recessively inherited pediatric neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons.

Discovering a cure for these fast-progressing diseases has remained elusive as only one FDA approved treatment exists for ALS, a drug called Riluzole, which prolongs a patient’s life modestly by about one year. No treatment exists for SMA. Clearly, more substantive therapeutic options are required to improve the survival and quality of life for these patients. The scientific community agrees that the search for new therapeutics for these debilitating motor neuron diseases requires highly-innovative strategies, including generating and optimizing a large database of patient-specific cellular (neuronal for ALS) data, with the ultimate goal being that these datasets will further encourage and stimulate “out-of-the-box ideas” in the broader neurodegenerative disease research field.

# Goals

The goal of NeuroLINCS will be to utilize high-quality non-integrating induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from ALS patients and unaffected normal healthy controls and identify signatures that are specific to motor neuron diseases and may be useful in grouping subset of patients. These cells can be generated from a simple blood draw from the patient – and can then be converted to make any cell type (brain, heart, muscle etc.) similar to those found in the patient’s body, including motor neurons and glial support cells that are either lost or dysfunctional in these patients. The iPS cells capture the patient’s genetic coding material, and retain the ability to be converted into any human cell type, providing an unlimited supply of patient cells that can be studied in the dish. Both SMA and ALS are progressive in nature, selectively affecting motor neurons in children and adults, respectively, often resulting in death. It remains unclear how motor neurons are specifically vulnerable to degeneration in both diseases, and increasing motor neuron survival is one of the best predictors of finding successful therapies.

Our initial focus will be to produce diseased motor neurons from patients to better understand why this happens. Using state-of-the-art OMICS methods (epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and cellomics), we intend to create a wealth of cellular data that is patient-specific in the context of their baseline genetic perturbations and in the presence of other environmental stressors (glutamate and endoplasmic reticulum stress). Ultimately, the analysis of these datasets will lead to the identification of a network of unique signatures relevant to each of these motor neuron diseases.
