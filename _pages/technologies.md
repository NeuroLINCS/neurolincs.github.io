iPSC:

    alt: "ipsc"
    title: "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)"
    excerpt: "iPSCs are generated using the latest techniques to reprogram, expand and characterize human iPS cells from human skin or blood tissues of healthy subjects and diseased patients. We then turn the iPS cells into specific cells of the human body, including components of the nervous system for use by researchers."

Perturbations:

    alt: "perturbations"
    title: "Perturbations"
    excerpt: "The genetic disease background in iPSC lines from individuals with SMA (SMN1 mutation), C9ORF72 repeat expansion associated ALS (C9-ALS) and sporadic ALS are genetic perturbagens associated with relevant iPSC-derived CNS cell types we will generate (e.g. Motor neurons). Importantly, additional chemical perturbagens will be selected based on their applicability to a wide range of cell types and cellular signaling pathways."

Transcriptomics:

    alt: "transcriptomics"
    title: "Transcriptomics"
    excerpt: "RNA-Seq is a deep sequencing approach to transcriptome profiling. Studies using this method will precisely measure the extent and complexity of transcriptional perturbations in iPSC derived motor neurons."

    excerpt: "iPSCs are generated using the latest techniques to reprogram, expand and characterize human iPS cells from human skin or blood tissues of healthy subjects and diseased patients.

    alt: "epigenomics"
    title: "Epigenomics"
    excerpt: "ATACseq is a relatively new transposase-based, deep sequencing based epigenomic assay to map open chromatin regions and infer regulatory protein binding sites."

Imaging:

    alt: "imaging"
    title: "Robotic Imaging"
    excerpt: "Automated robotic microscopy (RM) is used to identify and track live individual neurons in a high throughput and high content fashion over time. Automated image analysis is used to quantify intermediate changes in the physiology of a given cell and relate it to that cell's fate. From these measurements, mulivariate predictive dynamic models of cell fate are constructed that weigh co-variates based on the magnitude and nature of their predictive power. These models offer a signature of the cell's biology and a blueprint for rational therapeutic interventions."
