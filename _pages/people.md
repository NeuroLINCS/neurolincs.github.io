    alt: "Finkbeiner, Steve (MD, PhD)"
    title: "Finkbeiner, Steve (MD, PhD)"
    excerpt: "Dr. Finkbeiner studies the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for learning, memory and neurodegeneration. A better understanding of the mechanisms that control memory formation in neurons will yield crucial insights into the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases    - and the memory disorders that often characterize them."

    alt: "Fraenkel, Ernest (PhD)"
    title: "Fraenkel, Ernest (PhD)"
    excerpt: "Prof. Fraenkel received his A.B. in Chemistry and Physics from Harvard College and his Ph.D. in Biology at the laboratory of Professor Carl Pabo at MIT. He continued his post-doctoral research as a fellow at the laboratory of Professor Stephen Harrison at Harvard University. He was a Whitehead Fellow and a Pfizer Computational Biology Fellow at the Whitehead Institute. Prof. Fraenkel joined the MIT Department of Biological Engineering in 2006."

    alt: "Rothstein, Jeffrey (MD, PhD)"
    title: "Rothstein, Jeffrey (MD, PhD)"
    excerpt: "Professor Rothstein is a neurologist/neurobiologist with a major commitment to investigations of the biology of glutamate transporters and their role in acute and chronic neurodegeneration. A primary focus of his laboratory is understanding the basic regulation of astroglial and neuronal glutamate transporters, and how dysregulation of these proteins- or their associated regulatory proteins, could contribute to neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative conditions."

    alt: "Sareen, Dhruv (PhD)"
    title: "Sareen, Dhruv (PhD)"
    excerpt: "Independent scientist and leader in the field of pluripotent and neural system cell research. Developed and probed disease mechanisms in human iPSC-based disease models of SMA and ALS. Generated neuronal differentiation protocols from iPSCs amenable for disease modeling, high-throughput screening and regenerative medicine. Established the CSMC iPS cell Core housing one of the largest non-integrating iPS cell line repository from patients with multitude of diseases."

    alt: "Svendsen, Clive (PhD)"
    title: "Svendsen, Clive (PhD)"
    excerpt: "Modeling and treating neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Parkinson's disease using a combination of stem cells and powerful growth factors."

    alt: "Thompson, Leslie M. (PhD)"
    title: "Thompson, Leslie M. (PhD)"
    excerpt: "Discoveries in human genetics have allowed investigators to make significant progress in understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that are disrupted by these mutations and to develop rational therapeutics. The research in the Thompson lab has focused on understanding the cellular and transcriptomic signatures underlying neurodegenerative disease perturbations to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets for treatment of these diseases."

Jennifer:
  - image_path: people/jennifer_van-eyk.jpg
    alt: "Van Eyk, Jennifer (PhD)"
    title: "Van Eyk, Jennifer (PhD)"
    excerpt: "Our central philosophy is that compelling biological and clinical questions drive innovation through development, optimization and adaption of proteomic technologies, functional analysis, and large-scale data handling. Our primary research focuses i) on understanding the molecular mechanism underlying acute and chronic disease and treatment therapies and ii) in the development of clinically robust circulating biomarkers including detailed exosome constituents. My laboratory is well known for their analytes and process control and rigor."
